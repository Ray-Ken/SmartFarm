# SmartFarm

Project presented in the Software Engineering course (Universidade de Aveiro), 2018.

The main goal was to develop a system capable of helping the farmers to monitor its farm, using different types of sensors.
The system collects the data from the sensors in farms and shows them in real-time, also allowing to define alerts based on the data coming from the sensors.

The platform was made using SpringBoot (Java) and followed DevOps techniques.
Several technologies were used to follow a micro-services arquitecture, like Docker, Kafka, Kafka streams, ReactJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Jenkins, Cucumber, TICK Stack, ELK Stack, among others.
